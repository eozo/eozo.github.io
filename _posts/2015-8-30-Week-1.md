Hi, and welcome to my blog! I have successfully completed the first week of Downing’s Object Oriented Programming class! (Not that it was the most difficult week since things are just getting started, but still). Instead of iClickers we are using TopHat to take attendance. I’ve never been in a class that has used TopHat before, and it is both interesting and slightly irksome--I bought my iClicker my very first semester here at UT and have used it every semester since. TopHat on the other hand requires a subscription for (so far) what seems to be the exact same thing we would use iClickers for. But we have only had two classes after all, so maybe there is some other aspect of TopHat that we just haven’t gotten around to using yet. 

So far the class seems like it will be very interesting, a lot of the initial material we’ve touched on, such as unit tests, assertions, and coverage, were things I encountered for the first time at my internship this summer. It seems odd to me that something that is so important was never mentioned before in any of my other classes, but now that I’m learning about it in a class I’m glad that I’ve had some exposure to it already--it helps to have some non-academic context to which I can apply the ideas and concepts we are learning. 

Downing also likes to call on people throughout the class to answer questions about pieces of code. While this is something that would normally make me squeamish, I have already been called on to answer some questions and found that it was not a big deal--everybody is going to get called on eventually and I’m sure a lot of people stop paying attention to what the students are saying after the first or second person has been called on. The most important part is what Downing is saying anyways--calling on students is just a helpful way to step through the code and introduce new concepts and correct some misconceptions that some (or many) students may have.
