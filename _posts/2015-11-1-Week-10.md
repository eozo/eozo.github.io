title: Week 10
---
November is finally here, and there are only thirteen days of OOP left! This past week we were introduced to our next project, Darwin’s World, which is actually due this upcoming Thursday. If I recall correctly, I think we actually made a similar program in either my 312 or 314 class in which at the end of the number of turns the Wolf creature had to be the most numerous one. 

On Wednesday we had a guest speaker, Conrad Stoll, from Mutual Mobile. His presentation was mainly about the benefit of using and contributing to open source projects, and he gave many examples or open source projects that Mutual Mobile used to speed up their development process. He also gave examples of open source software that Mutual Mobile had created and released, such as their MMWormhole project which is now one of the most widely used libraries for bridging the data transfer gap between an iPhone and the Apple Watch. As somebody who has never contributed or thought about contributing to an open source project, it was interesting to hear what he had to say on the topic, and he mentioned a lot of different open source libraries that I’m interested in trying out on my own for mobile development. 

The papers we read this week were over getters and setters, and how the use of getters and setters are not actually object oriented, and can be dangerous because they give outside access to implementation details. This was something I had not previously considered, as I have used getters and setters widely on my project and work, and so have the other student developers. After reading the papers though, it makes me wonder how much work it would take to have a refactored project which did not use getter and setters.
