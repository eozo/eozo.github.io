title: Week 3
---
One project down, four to go! (And three weeks down, twelve to go, but who’s counting). This week we had our first project, Collatz, due. I actually heard from other people who are in or have taken Software Engineering with Professor Downing that they actually have the same first project that we do. Overall the project was not a difficult one, but was a really good way for us to learn the development tools and processes that we will be using throughout the semester. 

On Wednesday we had our first guest speaker, Chris Martin. Chris was a former student of Professor Downing’s who now works full time at Bloomberg in New York City. It was interesting to hear him give a brief overview of what Bloomberg does as well as the tech that Bloomberg uses in their development process. From what he said it sounded like Bloomberg uses a lot of its own development tools, although Chris did mention that he was trying to get his team to migrate over to using Jira, which is what we used at HomeAway this past summer. While it was good to hear what the development process was like at a company as large as Bloomberg, I personally do not think that I would want to work there, only because I do not find the product of financial services to be an interesting one.

We also had a couple of papers to read this past week over pair-programming and agile development. They presented research that showed that projects developed using pair-programming were not only finished more quickly but had less mistakes and bugs in the code--which accurately mirrors my own personal experiences when working in groups for class projects.
