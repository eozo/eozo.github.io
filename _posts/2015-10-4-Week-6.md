title: Week 6
---
Week 6 down, nine more to go! This past week we learned about lambdas, which I thought was very interesting since lambdas are something that haven't been very clear to me whenever I have encountered them in other languages in the past. Also, the concept of "capturing" a variable is a new one to me as well.... Or maybe it's just the name that makes it seem like a new concept. I guess it's not too different from passing something by value, so that when the variable is  later changed, that value is unaffected. 

One of the papers we read this week was over the Single Responsibility principle, which had the main point that a class should never have more than one reason to change. The other paper was on the Open-Closed Principle which states that classes should be open for extension but not for modification. After reading these papers I can say that I have first-hand experience of how chaotic things can get when these principles aren't followed--at my job here on campus student developers including myself have been working on an educational video game whose code base has become rather large. Unfortunately we have run into several problems throughout development because the above principles were not stuck to, and it only resulted in more refactoring and work on our part. 

On a slightly different note, the first exam is this week!  It's going to be a lot of material to cover, but luckily we get to bring a sheet of notes to help us (although no code!).
