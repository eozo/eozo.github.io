title: Week 11

I know I express the same sentiment almost every week, but I can’t believe we only have four weeks left of class (actually less if you factor in the time off for Thanksgiving)! The end of my undergraduate career is quickly approaching, and now that we’ve turned in project 4 I’m about to start the last computer science class project of my college career. I hope it will be as fun as working on Darwin’s World, as so far that has been my favorite project this semester.

This week in class Downing started going over inheritance in C++, and it was really helpful how he kept going back and forth to compare inheritance in Java vs C++. He also pointed out a lot of subtleties that either I hadn’t paid attention to before or didn’t know existed. I just hope I can remember all the subtle details when I go to write code of my own!

One of this week’s papers was about the disconnect between what is taught to CS students at universities versus what the industry needs or is looking for. The author brought up the point that in other industries, “professional” implies that one is licensed. However this is missing in the software development industry, and he pointed out that he wouldn’t even know where to start in terms of gathering individuals or organizations to administer some sort of licensing exam. I think that because the CS field is changing so rapidly and new technologies are always being developed, it might be difficult to come up with a way to administer licensing exams in a way which makes sure the exam is relevant to the actual knowledge one will need to succeed in the field. But at the same time I think that having a standard or a minimum bar so-to-speak is important to insure quality in the field.
