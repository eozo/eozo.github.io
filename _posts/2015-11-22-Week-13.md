title: Week 13
---
Week thirteen is complete, the last project has been turned in, and it’s hard to believe there are only three more class days of OOP left! 

This past week we learned more about method overriding and inheritance, and as usual Professor Downing was able to lead us to some revelation about the subtleties of inheritance in C++ that I would have totally missed if I had just been reading about the topic on my own. That has been one of the reason I have enjoyed this class so much--the way it is taught, we aren’t just told “this is done this way and that is done that way because of A, B and C.” Instead, as a class we walk through a problem and evaluate why we might want to approach a problem a certain way, and in this way we learn about the differences between C++ and Java, as well as how certain choice may seem insignificant when writing a line of code, but may have much larger implications for the rest of the program. 

This week’s articles were about women in tech. One was about Sheryl Sandberg, the current COO of Facebook. Much of what I read in the article reminded of me of what I heard Sheryl say to the audience during her plenary talk at this year’s Grace Hopper conference, which as I mentioned during a previous blog post, I found very inspiring. The second article opened with a discussion of how there is a pervasive idea in society that women in tech have to be good at everything in order to belong to tech--and that they deserve to be in tech because of this brilliance and talent, not just because they’re normal people who want to work in tech. The xkcd cartoon in the article was the perfect example:

As a female in tech, I will admit that I am guilty of having thoughts such as this, even though it is not intentional. I think one of the most challenging things will be changing how we view ourselves, as these ideas are so deeply ingrained that we almost don’t realize that we hold these views until they are pointed out to us by others.
