title: Week 12

On Monday this week we learned about our final project, Life, which is similar to our last project but instead of creatures the board is populated with cells and each turn is considered an “evolution” where cells either live, die, or come back to life. However setting up the game this time is slightly more complex, as we have to make use of an abstract class as well as a handler class. The board is also templated this time to handle the different types of cells it may contain. Overall, I’m finding this project to be very interesting. 

Wednesday we had our last guest speaker---or actually speakers, as there were two speakers from Atlassian. They discussed their development process, and since I used Jira at my internship this past summer I found it interesting to see what the development process was like for the people who actually made Jira! The two speakers were actually on the HipChat team though, which I did not use at my internship although I know another intern whose team did. Nevertheless, it was fun to have some insight into a company who creates such widely used project.  

One of this week’s papers was over the topic of continuous integration. It was something I was entirely unfamiliar with until my internship this past summer. During my internship I participated in the continuous integration process several times when I had to make a change to the core API to support the project I was working on. Also a couple times during my project somebody pushed a change that broke the build, and everybody was immediately alerted that the project had been broken, and it was immediately fixed. Because of instances such as this, I think any large project could only benefit from implementing a system of continuous integration.
