title: Week 2

Second week of OOP complete! The majority of this past week was spent going over what we need to do for our first project, Collatz. While the actual code content isn’t too hard (and Professor Downing completed most of it already), this project is meant to be a way for us to get used to the project workflow we will be using all semester. It’s been interesting getting to use Travis CI, a continuous integration tool. At my internship this summer a different tool, TeamCity was used, but I didn’t have the opportunity to interact with it too much. I like the UI of Travis CI a lot more than TeamCity’s, but as I recall TeamCity was also a lot more complicated to use.

Our assigned reading for this past week also included a couple of papers concerning advice for college students. I was relieved to see that I had done most things mentioned in Joel Spolsky’s article, except for the part about learning microeconomics before graduating. I will admit that I have known (after being told by my father and others) that I should try and take some business classes while I’m in college, but I never seemed to get around to doing so. Instead I took other electives such as European Expansion in Asia or Intro to the Study of Language. But now that I’m in my last semester I wish I knew a bit more about things that could help me once I’m out of school and on my own--things like basic finance or investing or even basic economics. I’m not quite sure how I managed to get through all my years of school without ever taking an economics class actually… but it looks like at this point I’m going to have to take the initiative and learn it on my own!
