title: Final Week

The end of OOP has come and gone, although I have to say it came a lot sooner than expected! Overall I’m really glad this was my final computer science class of my undergraduate career. The class was a very engaging one, and (partially due to the fear of being called on and not knowing what was going on) the subject matter always managed to hold my attention. Most importantly, I feel like I’ve walked away with information that I can actually use in the real world.

I’ve mentioned it before but it’s worth saying again, part of the reason the class is such a good one is that Professor Downing has a way of presenting the class with a problem or situation, and then leading us towards a conclusion without outright telling us what the lesson that we are supposed to learn. We spend the whole class thinking instead of just having information read to us off of slides, which makes it infinitely easier to both pay attention and actually learn the information. 

Projects required effort and time, but not unreasonably so. It was definitely worth the time put in, and I never felt as if I were wasting my time. And while there are no drop grades in the course for any quizzes or assignments, I felt that the amount of extra credit offered with the blog posts, Seelio portfolio, Piazza questions, working with partners, and completing the eCIS were more than comparable. 

One thing I could never figure out is Professor Downing’s system for calling on students--by a little over halfway through the semester I had been called four times total while the person next to me had only ever been called on once. Perhaps some students are luckier than others…. I guess it will forever be a mystery.

Thanks Professor Downing, it’s been a great last semester! \m/
