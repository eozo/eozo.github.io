title: Week 4
---
Week four is complete! We spent all of Monday going over the problem for our next project, Voting, which is actually due this Thursday night. The entire process for the project seems to be very similar to the first project, except that the problem we are solving is the “Australian Voting” problem. Another thing that is different for this project is that we are given absolutely no code, although I have found that using our previous project’s code as a model has proven to be helpful for things such as the .travis.yml file and the makefile. 

This week we also learned about the nuanced differences in C++ between pointers and references, most of which I had forgotten since it has been well over a year since I took the CS 105 class on C++ and never used C++ after the class. I think this is the first class I have had that has expected us to mess with the makefiles as well--it is not something I am familiar with or have done before. 

Both of the papers assigned for reading this week were concerned with the topic of simple coding mistakes causing the failure of large projects such as NASA’s Mariner 1. It reminded me of the article we read on the Therac-25 in Dr. Norman’s Operating Systems class. 

On another note, the CNS career fair is tomorrow afternoon, time to brush up the resume and print out some copies for tomorrow! Then after that it’s back to finishing up the second project.
