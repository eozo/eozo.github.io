title: Week 5
---
Week five is complete, and it’s hard to believe we’re already one third of the way through the fall semester. Career fair was on monday, and interviews are already well underway. It’s also time to start applying to graduate! 

This week’s readings continued the same theme from last week’s papers--how mistakes or oversights in code can have huge repercussions. The papers for this week were over the Patriot Missile and its roundoff error which resulted in a missile hitting a U.S. Army barracks in Saudi Arabia. We also learned about templates this week, which I thought was a much more efficient way of having a Java overloaded method--instead of writing the same function multiple times with different data types, you can write the function once using multiple templates. Also, on Wednesday there was a guest speaker from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which I can only assume was very interesting since I unfortunately was unable to attend class that day. Hopefully there will be slides posted like from the Bloomberg guest presentation so we can look through them. 

The second project was due this past week, but instead of starting on the third project it is time to start studying for the first exam, which is only about a week and a half away! It’s probably time to start catching up on the book readings. Then the week after that is Grace Hopper, which I have been lucky enough to have been accepted to attend as part of UTCS’s group this year, so it looks like the next several weeks are going to be pretty busy!
