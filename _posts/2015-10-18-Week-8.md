Well the semester is officially more than halfway over, and this past Monday we learned about our next project, which is to create an allocator. I was not in class Wednesday or Friday because I was attending the Grace Hopper conference in Houston!

This was my first time attending Grace Hopper, and overall I have to say that it was a pretty amazing experience! We arrived Wednesday in the early afternoon and the conference ended Friday night with a big celebration event at Minute Maid Park. There were an incredibly large number of different sessions being held, which made it hard to choose which ones to attend! 

One of the sessions I attended the first day was a Birds-of-a-Feather discussion about the ethics and morals of virtual and augmented reality, and it was led by two Virtual Reality Evangelists from Microsoft. It was really interesting to hear the different concerns and ideas people shared about VR--they ranged from being worried about how violent games in virtual reality would affect the pysche to musings about how virtual reality could be used as a therapy for people with physical or social disabilities. 

Another interesting talk was the Wednesday plenary talk, where one of the speakers was Megan Smith, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. I had never considered (or even thought of) working for the federal government as a computer scientist, so it was really enlightening to hear about the work being done at the federal level. I also have a potential new career path that I can consider!

Overall though, I have to say that my favorite part of Grace Hopper was Sheryl Sandberg’s plenary talk that was on Thursday afternoon. She was a fantastic speaker and I found what she had to say to be incredibly inspiring. Rather than go into detail, it would be better for you to just watch it for yourself, so I’ve linked it below!
