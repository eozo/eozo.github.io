title: Week 9
---

It’s hard to believe we only have one week left of October, and only six weeks left of class! This week we went over the process of creating a custom Vector class, and how to modify it to accept a non-standard allocator. We also learned what the keyword “explicit” does, which was interesting because while I have seen it before I never actually knew what it did. We also went over the “friend” keyword, and the difference between overriding an operator as a function or a method. 

We also had another two papers to read this week, although this week’s quizzes didn’t have anything to do with the readings and were instead over the concepts we had learned in class.The first paper was over the topic of stability of an object-oriented design. The author states that while interdependence is necessary in order for the different parts of a package to work properly, too much or the incorrect type of interdependence create a design which is too rigid and can easily break in multiple places when a single change is made. Thus the goal is for our code to be as stable as possible when change occurs. The second paper argues for the use of interface inheritance over the use of implementation inheritance, mainly because implementation inheritance reduces one’s flexibility because one is restricted to a specific implementation, which can make future changes more difficult, and implementation inheritance introduces coupling, or interdependency. 

We also turned in Project 3 this week, and now it’s time to start Project 4, which looks like it will be really fun!
