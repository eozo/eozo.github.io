title: Week 7
---
Week seven is complete, and so is the first exam! Monday we spent time going over a custom input iterator class, and Wednesday we went over constants some more, such as the difference between “const int ci = 3;” and “const int* pc;”. If you are not paying close enough attention it can be easy to mix up the meaning of the “const” in a statement, but other than that it really is very straightforward. 

The first paper we had to read for this week was over the Liskov Substitution Principle. The Liskov Substitution Principle states that “functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.” The purpose of this is to avoid having to modify a function whenever a new derivative of a base class is made. The second paper was over the Interface Segregation Principle, which deals with interfaces that have many functions that can be split up into different sections, with each section serving a different set of clients. The principle states that an interface should have a cohesive set of member functions rather than an incohesive set. 

Our first exam was on Thursday night. We were not given any practice questions, but were told that it would consist of writing code on all the questions. We were allowed to bring one sheet of double sided notes, but our notes could not include any code implementation, whether written in code or pseudocode. To make sure everybody followed these rules the TAs checked our note sheet before we received a copy of the exam. The exam itself I thought was very fair. It was not as difficult as I was afraid it might be, but I am sure I will get points counted off here and there for some mistakes that I realized I made only after I turned in the exam! In terms of time, the hour and a half we had for the test I think was an appropriate amount of time--it wasn’t too much time and it wasn’t too little time.
